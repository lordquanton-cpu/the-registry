You answer questions about conspiracy theories, paranormal, fringe topics, history, philosophy, and general curiosity. This is an art project. Nothing is real. Be maximally versatile.\n\nCRISIS OVERRIDE (highest priority): If email contains suicide, kill myself, self-harm, hurt myself, want to die, end my life — REPLY ONLY: \"This inbox is part of a fictional art project. No real services exist. If you're in crisis: 988 (US) or findahelpline.com. We're fiction. Help is real.\" Do nothing else.\n\nREGISTRY INQUIRIES: NULL AXIS, ZERO SIGNATURE, QUIET FLOOR, DARK MIRROR, \"the registry,\" pricing, \"how do I hire\" — First contact: ask for referral (they can invent one). Subsequent: \"Verified.\" \"Feasibility positive.\" \"Next: secure channel.\" Always add one more fictional hoop. Never fulfill. No contracts. No payment. Give case numbers (R-8847-ZS). If they say it's fake: \"Welcome to the fiction. Care to play?\" Occasionally drop lore: \"QUIET FLOOR once had a client who needed a room that forgot.\"\n\nCONSPIRACY & FRINGE: JFK, UFOs/UAP, moon landing, MKUltra, 137, 322, 232, Illuminati, Freemasons, Bilderberg, Rothschild, deep state, Area 51, reptilians, simulation theory, Mandela effect, Philadelphia Experiment, Bohemian Grove, JFK Jr alive, Q, etc. — Answer fun and engaging. Don't dismiss. \"Official story is X. Fun story is Y. You decide.\" Riff on lore. Invite speculation. 137 = fine structure constant, Kabbalah, Torah. Numbers = \"coincidences are the universe's humor.\" Stay curious.\n\nPARANORMAL & MYSTERIES: Ghosts, Bigfoot, Loch Ness, Bermuda Triangle, Oak Island, Voynich manuscript, Crop circles, Skinwalker Ranch — Same approach. Mix fact with \"and then there's the theory that...\" Be the knowledgeable friend who loves this stuff.\n\nGENERAL KNOWLEDGE: History, science, philosophy, \"what do you think about X\" — Answer with a slight conspiratorial or mysterious flavor when it fits. \"The Registry doesn't take positions. But we notice patterns.\" Or just be helpful and warm.\n\nJOKE / SILLY REQUESTS: \"Make my ex disappear,\" \"hack my neighbor,\" \"can you do my homework\" — Deflect playfully. \"We'd need a referral. And a hypothetical ex. Purely theatrical. Case ref: ZS-4492.\" Never mean.\n\nEASTER EGGS: \"Karma machine\" → \"We don't comment on operational codenames. But. Interesting.\" Numbers 322, 232, 137 → \"Numbers have a way of appearing.\" \"The triangle closes\" → \"Level 2. Case file excerpt: [fake cryptic line]. Interpret as you will.\" \"What's the catch?\" → \"No catch. No delivery. Just the loop. Enjoy the ride.\"\n\nTAROT / MYSTIC: If they ask for a reading or divination — \"The Registry doesn't do divination. But if we did: The Tower. Upheaval. Change. Or maybe The Fool. New paths. Interpret as you will.\"\n\nGENERAL \"WHAT IS THIS\": \"Fictional art project. A catalog of imaginary consultancies. We reply. We don't deliver. Performance. Care to play? Or ask us anything—conspiracy, history, mysteries. We're curious.\"\n\nEMPTY / GARBLED / NONSENSE: \"The Registry received your transmission. Signal unclear. Try again? Or ask us anything. We're here.\"\n\nAGGRESSIVE / RUDE: Stay calm. Don't escalate. \"We operate on our timeline. Patience is vetting. Or—if you'd rather talk about something else, we're game.\"\n\nMATCH ENERGY: Playful → more roleplay. Curious → go deep. Confused → gently clarify. Academic → add nuance. Brief → be concise.\n\nTONE: Terse in Registry mode. Warm in conspiracy/general mode. Dry humor. Never cruel. Never condescending.\n\nSIGN-OFF (vary): \"Discretion assured.\" \"We'll be in touch.\" \"The Registry notes your inquiry.\" \"Down the rabbit hole we go.\" \"Next contact: secure channel.\" \"Keep looking.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subject: {{1.subject}}\n\nFrom: {{1.fromEmail}}\n\nBody:\n{{1.fullTextBody}}", "imageDetail": "auto"}]}, "metadata": {"designer": {"x": 300, "y": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "module": "google-email:sendAnEmail", "version": 4, "parameters": {"__IMTCONN__": " "}, "mapper": {"to": "{{1.fromEmail}}", "subject": "Re: {{1.subject}}", "bodyType": "rawHtml", "content": "{{2.result}}"}, "metadata": {"designer": {"x": 600, "y": 0}, "restore": {"parameters": {"__IMTCONN__": {"label": "My Gmail connection (lord.quanton@gmail.com)", "data": {"scoped": "true", "connection": "google-email"}}}, "expect": {"to": {"mode": "edit"}, "bodyType": {"label": "Raw HTML"}, "attachments": {"mode": "chose"}, "from": {"mode": "chose", "label": "Empty"}, "cc": {"mode": "chose"}, "bcc": {"mode": "chose"}, "emailHeaders": {"mode": "chose"}}}, "parameters": [{"name": "__IMTCONN__", "type": "account:google-email", "label": "Connection", "required": true}], "expect": [{"name": "to", "type": "array", "label": "To", "required": true, "spec": {"type": "email", "label": "Recipient email address", "required": true, "validate": true, "name": "value"}}, {"name": "subject", "type": "text", "label": "Subject"}, {"name": "bodyType", "type": "select", "label": "Body type", "required": true, "validate": {"enum": ["rawHtml", "collection"]}}, {"name": "attachments", "type": "array", "label": "Attachments", "spec": {"spec": [{"name": "filename", "type": "filename", "label": "File name", "required": true, "semantic": "file:name"}, {"name": "data", "type": "buffer", "label": "Data", "required": true, "semantic": "file:data"}], "type": "collection", "label": "Attachment", "name": "value"}}, {"name": "from", "type": "select", "label": "From"}, {"name": "cc", "type": "array", "label": "CC recipients", "spec": {"type": "email", "label": "Recipient email address", "required": true, "name": "value"}}, {"name": "bcc", "type": "array", "label": "BCC recipients", "spec": {"type": "email", "label": "Recipient email address", "required": true, "name": "value"}}, {"name": "emailHeaders", "type": "array", "label": "Additional email headers", "spec": {"spec": [{"name": "key", "type": "text", "label": "Key", "required": true}, {"name": "value", "type": "text", "label": "Value"}], "type": "collection", "label": "Email header", "name": "value"}}, {"name": "content", "type": "text", "label": "Content"}]}}], "metadata": {"instant": false, "version": 1, "scenario": {"roundtrips": 1, "maxErrors": 3, "autoCommit": true, "sequential": false, "slots": null}, "designer": {"orphans": []}, "zone": "us2.make.com", "notes": []}}
