# DEEP POCKET — Inquiry Protocol
## How to Engage

![Inquiry Flow](./assets/inquiry-protocol.png)

---

## Vetting

We do not accept unsolicited inquiries. Introduction through existing client or verified channel required. Initial contact establishes:

1. **Referral** — How you were directed to us
2. **Scope** — Nature of engagement (no specifics required at intake)
3. **Capacity** — Ability to meet payment terms

**No charge for assessment.** We determine feasibility before any commitment.

## Contact Channels

| Channel | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Secure drop** | [Protocol-specific. Provided upon referral.] |
| **Encrypted channel** | Signal/Session. Key provided upon referral. |
| **Dead drop** | Physical. For high-sensitivity engagements. |

*No email. No phone. No trace.*

## Payment Terms

1. **Currency** — Cryptocurrency (BTC, XMR) or structured finance. No fiat trace.
2. **Timing** — Advance fees. Outcome-contingent available for qualified clients (separate addendum).
3. **Structure** — Standard: 50% at engagement, 50% at milestone. War Chest: outcome-contingent. Qualified only.
4. **Escrow** — Multisig available for engagements over $1M.
