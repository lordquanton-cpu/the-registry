## Who We Are

DEAD LETTER provides **secure messaging** and **document destruction services** for clients whose communications must never be recovered. Every message burns. Every document dissolves. Forensics find nothing.

**Send it. Burn it. It never existed.**

---

## What We Do

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Secure Messaging** | End-to-end encrypted channels with guaranteed destruction on read |
| **Document Destruction** | Physical and digital—forensic-grade erasure |
| **Information Burial** | Deep archiving with controlled access and timed deletion |
| **Burn Protocols** | Message fabrication that never existed in the first place |

---

## Why We Exist

Records persist. Backups persist. Metadata persists. Our clients require communication that **cannot** persist. We provide channels where messages self-destruct, documents vanish, and forensic recovery is impossible.

**No archive. No log. No trace.**

---

## Our Principles

1. **Ephemeral by design** — Nothing we touch survives beyond its purpose.
2. **Forensic denial** — Recovery is not possible. We guarantee it.
3. **No retention** — We do not store. We route and burn.
4. **Prepayment** — Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No refunds.
