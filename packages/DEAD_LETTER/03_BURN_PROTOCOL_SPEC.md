### Executive Summary

The Burn Protocol is our flagship offering: end-to-end secure messaging with guaranteed destruction on read, plus forensic-grade physical document and device destruction. No server retention. No forensic recovery. We route. You send. The message burns. Documents dissolve. **Nothing remains.**

**We do not ask why. We deliver oblivion.**

## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Burn Protocol** is a coordinated secure-messaging and document-destruction system that provides ephemeral channels (destruction on read), forensic-grade physical burn services, and guaranteed elimination of recoverable records—ensuring that what was sent or stored never existed.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Burn Protocol is a multi-tier messaging and destruction system comprising ephemeral channels (no retention), physical document burn, device obliteration, and timed deletion—operating in drop, stream, vault, or full-protocol modes toward complete forensic denial of the client's communications and records.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: it never existed.**

## II. THE EXPERIENCE (What the Client Receives)

*This is not encryption. This is erasure.*

You send. The message routes. The recipient reads. The message burns. No copy. No log. No recovery. Forensics find nothing. The server never held it. The channel never logged it. **It never existed.**

Documents. Devices. We burn them. Forensic grade. Recovery impossible. We guarantee it.

**You paid for that. We deliver it.**
