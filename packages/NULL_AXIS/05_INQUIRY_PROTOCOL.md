## How to Engage

## Vetting

We do not accept unsolicited inquiries. Introduction through existing client or verified channel required. Initial contact establishes:

1. **Referral** — How you were directed to us
2. **Scope** — Nature of engagement (no specifics required at intake)
3. **Capacity** — Ability to meet payment terms

**No charge for assessment.** We determine feasibility before any commitment.

|---------|-----|
| **Secure drop** | [Protocol-specific. Provided upon referral.] |
| **Encrypted channel** | Signal/Session. Key provided upon referral. |
| **Dead drop** | Physical. For high-sensitivity engagements. |

*No email. No phone. No trace.*

## Payment Terms

1. **Currency** — Cryptocurrency (BTC, XMR) or structured finance. No fiat trace.
2. **Timing** — Payment in advance. No exceptions. No refunds.
