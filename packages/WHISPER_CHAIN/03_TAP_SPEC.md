## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Tap** is a human intelligence system comprising source identification, cultivation, extraction, and network building—delivering verified intelligence that does not exist in any database.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Tap is a multi-tier HUMINT system comprising single, network, tap, and embedded modes—operating through source identification, cultivation, extraction, and network building toward verified intelligence delivery.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: someone always knows.**
