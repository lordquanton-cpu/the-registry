## Why We Exist

Our clients conduct sensitive discussions. Boardrooms. Safe houses. Negotiation venues. Conventional sweep finds nothing—but the room still transmits. We ensure it does not. No mic. No laser. No through-wall. **The room forgets.**

**No trace. No transmission. No listening.**

## Our Principles

1. **Silence by design** — We do not block. We overwhelm. The signal drowns.
2. **Invisible to occupants** — You speak normally. The room does not leak.
3. **Defeat by layer** — White noise. Ultrasonic. Infrasound. Redundant.
4. **Prepayment** — Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No refunds. No trace.
