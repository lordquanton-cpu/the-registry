### Executive Summary

The Blanket is our flagship offering: room-level acoustic hardening deployed for clients whose conversations must not be overheard. Remote microphones. Laser pickup. Through-wall vibration. We deploy layered acoustic countermeasures—white noise tailored to defeat voice-to-text, ultrasonic jamming, infrasound where applicable—so that the room transmits **nothing**. You speak normally. The space does not leak.

**We do not ask why. We deliver silence.**

## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Blanket** is a layered acoustic denial system that deploys tailored white noise, ultrasonic jamming, and optional infrasound to neutralize remote microphones, laser-based listening devices, and through-wall vibration pickup—rendering the space acoustically opaque while remaining imperceptible or minimally perceptible to occupants.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Blanket is a multi-layer acoustic denial system comprising tailored broadband noise (voice-to-text defeat), ultrasonic emitters (remote mic and laser pickup neutralization), and optional infrasound (sub-audible deterrence)—operating in assess, single-room, portable, or facility-wide modes toward complete acoustic opacity of the protected space.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: a room that forgets.**

## II. THE EXPERIENCE (What the Occupant Receives)

*This is not soundproofing. This is denial.*

You speak. The room does not transmit. You move. The wall does not vibrate. A remote mic in the vent hears only noise. A laser on the window reads only noise. Through-wall pickup registers only noise. Speech-to-text fails. Human transcription fails. **The room forgets.**

Occupants experience normal conversation. Optional: subtle white noise (adjustable). No discomfort. No awareness of countermeasures. The space is yours. The space is silent to the outside.

**You paid for that. We deliver it.**

## II-A. PRICING — What It Costs

### Market Context

*Our pricing reflects capability tier. Comparable references:*
- Commercial acoustic consulting (non-denial): **$5,000 – $20,000** per assessment
- SCIF-grade construction: **$500 – $2,000 / sq ft**
- White noise systems (basic): **$2,000 – $10,000** — *we are not basic. We defeat professional surveillance.*

**The Blanket is not a noise machine. It is acoustic oblivion. You are not buying sound. You are buying silence.**

## III. ARCHITECTURE — THE BLANKET'S BONES

*Our layers. Your guarantee.*

### System Type
| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Distribution** | Emitters + controllers + optional infrasound—all coordinated |
| **Hierarchy** | Central controller; zone-based deployment; no single point of failure |
| **Adaptivity** | Frequency profiles adjusted to known threat; recalibration on request |
| **Concurrency** | Multi-room capable. Facility-wide. Portable for ad-hoc venues. |

### The Layers (What Defeats Surveillance)

![The Blanket — Acoustic layer architecture: Broadband, Ultrasonic, Infrasound](./assets/blanket-architecture.png)

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| **Broadband** | Tailored white noise. Defeats voice-to-text. Defeats human transcription. Inaudible or minimally audible to occupants. |
| **Ultrasonic** | Beyond human hearing. Neutralizes remote mics. Defeats laser pickup. Through-wall mitigation. |
| **Infrasound** | Sub-audible. Optional. Pressure layer. Deterrence. Undetectable to standard sweep. |

### Acoustic Flow

```
Occupant speech → Room
       ↓
[BROADBAND] masks speech-to-text, human transcription
       ↓
[ULTRASONIC] neutralizes remote mic, laser, through-wall
       ↓
[INFRASOUND] (optional) pressure layer, sweep defeat
       ↓
External listener receives: noise. Nothing usable.
```

**There is no gap. The room forgets.**

## IV. CAPABILITIES — WHAT WE DELIVER

### Broadband Denial
| Capability | The Reality |
|------------|-------------|
| **Voice-to-text defeat** | Speech recognition systems receive noise. No usable transcript. |
| **Human transcription** | Masked. Unintelligible at distance. Adjustable level. |
| **Custom profiles** | Tailored to known surveillance. Specific frequency emphasis. |
| **Occupant comfort** | Minimal or zero perceptible noise. Optional adjustable. |

### Ultrasonic Neutralization
| Capability | The Reality |
|------------|-------------|
| **Remote mic defeat** | Ultrasonic wash. Mic receives overload. No clean signal. |
| **Laser pickup defeat** | Window vibration masked. Laser reads noise. No speech. |
| **Through-wall** | Vibration transmission mitigated. Adjacent room hears nothing usable. |
| **Sweep resistance** | Standard RF sweep finds nothing. Acoustic layer invisible to RF. |

### Infrasound (Optional)
| Capability | The Reality |
|------------|-------------|
| **Sub-audible** | Below human hearing. Pressure wave. No audible component. |
| **Deterrence** | Prolonged exposure. Discomfort. Unwelcoming. |
| **Sweep defeat** | Standard acoustic sweep may not detect. Specialized equipment required. |
| **Add-on** | Deployed as additional layer. Not standard. |
