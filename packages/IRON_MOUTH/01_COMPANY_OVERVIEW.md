## Why We Exist

Our clients face individuals who know too much. Witnesses. Former employees. Loose lips. Conventional NDAs lack enforcement. We provide **permanent silence** where discretion is existential.

**Some things are never said.**

## Our Principles

1. **Discretion** — We do not document. We do not retain. We do not ask what they know.
2. **Deniability** — They stay silent. No one knows why. We never tell.
3. **Delivery** — Silence delivered. Permanent. Or we do not charge.
4. **Prepayment** — Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No refunds. No trace.
