### Executive Summary

The Ghost Protocol is ZERO SIGNATURE's flagship offering: a comprehensive exfiltration-and-oblivion system that extracts principals from surveillance, sanitizes their digital footprint, establishes clean identity and financial trails, and buries anything that could lead back. For principals who need to disappear—or make something disappear—without trace.

**We don't ask why. We deliver oblivion.**

## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Ghost Protocol** is a coordinated exfiltration-and-erasure system that detects surveillance, extracts principals from hostile environments, sanitizes digital and financial traces, establishes clean identity packages, and executes permanent oblivion of recoverable records—physical, digital, and archival.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Ghost Protocol is a multi-phase, multi-vector exfiltration-and-oblivion system comprising threat assessment, counter-surveillance, physical extraction, identity resolution, financial extraction, and digital burial—operating in assessment, sanitization, extraction, or full-oblivion modes toward a principal's complete, permanent disappearance.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: no trace.**

---

## II. THE EXPERIENCE (What the Principal Receives)

*This is not relocation. This is erasure.*

You stop existing. Your devices are sanitized or destroyed. Your accounts close. Your digital footprint dies. Your financial trail terminates. Your face, your name, your history—replaced or buried. The people who were looking for you find nothing. The systems that tracked you go dark. You become someone else. Or no one.

**We engineer that. We deliver it.**

## III. ARCHITECTURE — THE PROTOCOL'S BONES

### System Type
| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Distribution** | Operators + secure infrastructure + safe-house network + document forgery pipelines |
| **Hierarchy** | Central coordination; regional execution; no single point of failure |
| **Adaptivity** | Responds to threat level, principal profile, surveillance detected |
| **Concurrency** | Multi-principal capable; family units; asset groups |

### The Phases

![Ghost Protocol — Six phases: Assessment, Counter-Surveillance, Extraction, Identity, Financial, Oblivion](./assets/ghost-protocol-layers.png)

| Phase | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Assessment** | Threat mapping. Surveillance detection. Feasibility. |
| **Counter-Surveillance** | Device sanitization. Comms lockdown. Dead-drop establishment. |
| **Extraction** | Physical exfil. Safe-house staging. Relocation. |
| **Identity Resolution** | New documents. Credit history. Backstory. |
| **Financial Extraction** | Value movement. Offshore. Clean trail. |
| **Oblivion** | Digital burial. Record erasure. Permanent closure. |

### Pipeline Flow

![Ghost Protocol — Assessment → Sanitization → Extraction → Identity → Oblivion](./assets/ghost-protocol-pipeline.png)

```
Principal in hostile environment
       ↓
[ASSESSMENT] — threat map, surveillance detect, feasibility
       ↓
[SANITIZATION] — devices clean, comms dead-drop, counter-surveillance active
       ↓
[EXTRACTION] — physical exfil, safe-house, relocation
       ↓
[IDENTITY] — new documents, history, credit trail
       ↓
[FINANCIAL] — value moved, offshore, clean
       ↓
[OBLIVION] — digital death, record burial, permanent
       ↓
Principal no longer exists. New identity. No trace.
