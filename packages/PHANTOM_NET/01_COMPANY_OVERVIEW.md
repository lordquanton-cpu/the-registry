## Who We Are

PHANTOM NET specializes in **digital forensics erasure** and **trail elimination**. Your past leaves traces. We remove them. Not just deletion—obliteration. Forensic recovery becomes impossible.

**What was there is gone. What was gone was never there.**

## What We Do

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Forensic Erasure** | Device, cloud, and backup—recovery impossible |
| **Trail Elimination** | Logs, metadata, transaction records—wiped |
| **Clean Exit** | Comprehensive protocol for disappearing from digital infrastructure |
| **Counter-Forensics** | Measures to defeat future investigation |

## Why We Exist

Deletion is not enough. Forensics recover. Backups persist. Metadata survives. We provide **guaranteed obliteration**—technical and procedural—so that what you did, where you were, and what you said cannot be reconstructed.

---

## Our Principles

1. **Obliteration not deletion** — Recovery impossible. We guarantee it.
2. **Full spectrum** — Device, cloud, backup, log, metadata.
3. **No remnant** — What we touch ceases to exist forensically.
4. **Prepayment** — Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No refunds.

## Sector Expertise

- **Defection** — Clean exit. Trail elimination.
- **Litigation** — Evidence. Discovery. Opposition.
- **Corporate** — Leak. M&A. Clean exit.
- **High-net-worth** — Digital footprint. Obliteration.
