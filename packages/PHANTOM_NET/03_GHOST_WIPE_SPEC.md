### Executive Summary

The Ghost Wipe is our flagship offering: full-spectrum digital trail elimination. Not deletion—**obliteration**. Device, cloud, backup, log, metadata. Forensic recovery impossible. We guarantee it. Counter-forensics included. What you did, where you were, what you said—cannot be reconstructed.

**We do not ask why. We deliver obliteration.**

## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Ghost Wipe** is a coordinated digital forensics erasure system that obliterates data from devices, clouds, backups, logs, and metadata—using techniques that guarantee forensic recovery is impossible, supplemented by counter-forensic measures to defeat future investigation.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Ghost Wipe is a multi-vector obliteration system comprising device erasure, cloud account termination, backup elimination, log and metadata removal, and counter-forensics—operating in single, spectrum, exit, or retro modes toward the client's complete digital invisibility and forensic denial.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: what was there is gone.**

## II. THE EXPERIENCE (What the Client Receives)

*This is not deletion. This is obliteration.*

Your devices: wiped. Forensic grade. Recovery impossible. Your cloud: gone. Accounts terminated. Backup obliterated. Logs: removed. Metadata: eliminated. What you did. Where you were. What you said. **Cannot be reconstructed.** Counter-forensics deployed. Future investigation finds nothing.

**You paid for that. We deliver it.**
