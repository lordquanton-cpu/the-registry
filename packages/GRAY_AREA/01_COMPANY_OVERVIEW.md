## Why We Exist

Merit does not always win. Process does. Our clients face litigation, regulation, or procedural barriers where **how** the system runs matters more than **what** is true. We manipulate the machinery.

## Our Principles

1. **Process over merit** — We work the system. We do not litigate facts.
2. **Plausible deniability** — All actions within legal bounds. Barely.
3. **Coordination** — We interface with counsel. We do not replace it.
4. **Prepayment** — Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No refunds.
