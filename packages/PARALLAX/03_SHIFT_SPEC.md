## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Shift** is an attribution redirection system that alters where evidence and narrative point—through planted material, narrative framing, and trail manipulation—so that blame and investigation focus elsewhere.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Shift is a multi-tier redirection system comprising single (one event), shift (coordinated), and parallax (extended) modes—operating toward client clearance from investigation or blame.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: the trail points elsewhere.**
