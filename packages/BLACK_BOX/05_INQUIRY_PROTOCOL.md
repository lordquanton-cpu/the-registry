## Vetting

We do not accept unsolicited inquiries. Introduction through existing client or verified channel required. Initial contact establishes:

1. **Referral** — How you were directed to us
2. **Scope** — Nature of engagement (no specifics required at intake)
3. **Capacity** — Ability to meet payment terms

**No charge for assessment.** We determine recovery feasibility before any commitment.
