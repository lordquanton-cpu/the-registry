## Who We Are

## Why We Exist

Our clients are watched. By adversaries. By states. By competitors. Conventional security assumes you will be observed—we assume you will not. Our job is to make you **invisible to those who seek you**.

**No trace. No pattern. No target.**

---

## Our Principles

1. **Evasion first** — We do not fight surveillance. We disappear from it.
2. **Operational discipline** — Our protocols work only when followed exactly.
3. **Deniability** — You were never there. You never did that.
4. **Prepayment** — Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No refunds. No trace.

## Sector Expertise

- **Defectors** — State exit. Witness protection. Whistleblower relocation.
- **Corporate** — Competitive intelligence countermeasures. Board-level discretion.
- **High-net-worth** — Stalking. Harassment. Discretion.
- **Journalist** — Hostile environment. Source protection. Safe movement.
