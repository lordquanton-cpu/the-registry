## I. CORE DEFINITIONS

### Primary Definition
**The Escort Protocol** is a coordinated physical security system that provides armed escort, route clearance, extraction support, and safe-haven delivery—moving principals from origin to destination with minimal exposure and maximum control.

### One-Sentence Definition
**The Escort Protocol is a multi-tier physical security system comprising escort, full-run (multi-leg), and full-protocol (extraction + identity) modes—operating toward the principal's safe delivery at designated destination.**

**What we offer: the full stack. What you get: you arrive.**

You move. We clear. Routes are secured. Handoffs occur. Extraction support available. Safe haven at destination. You are moved. No one moves us.
