# The Registry

> *A catalog of specialized service providers. Fictional. For art and curiosity.*

---

## What This Is

**The Registry** is conceptual art — a curated index of 24 fictional black-ops consultancies with complete product specs, pricing, and service agreements. Worldbuilding as documentation: the kind of catalog a shadow economy would produce.

**Nothing here is real.** No services. No contracts. No harm. Pure fiction.
