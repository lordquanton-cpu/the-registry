## What This Is

**The Registry** is a conceptual art project — a curated index of fictional black-ops-style consultancies, each with complete product specifications, pricing, and service agreements. Think of it as worldbuilding: a shared universe of deniable service providers, none of which exist.

**Nothing here is real.** No services are fulfilled. No contracts are executed. No one is harmed.

## Registry Members

| Provider | Sector |
|----------|--------|
| **NULL AXIS** | Strategic Influence. Covert Resolution. |
| **ZERO SIGNATURE** | Exfiltration. Oblivion. Counter-surveillance. |
| **QUIET FLOOR** | Acoustic denial. Sonic obfuscation. |
| **DARK MIRROR** | Reputation resurrection. Narrative repair. |

Full specifications in `/packages/[provider]/`.

## Inquiries

For the curious: **Lord.Quanton@gmail.com**

An AI agent responds. It never fulfills contracts. It engages inquiries in a friendly, mysterious loop — part roleplay, part performance art. Harmless. Entertaining. No one is scammed; no one is promised anything real.
