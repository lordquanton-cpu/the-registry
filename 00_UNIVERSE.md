# The Registry — Universe Frame

**Classification:** Meta. Canon.  
**Purpose:** Shared context for all providers.  
**Audience:** Worldbuilders. Curious readers. Contributors.

## What The Registry Is

A **curated index** of fictional black-ops consultancies operating in a shared, unnamed universe. No provider is real. No contract is executed. The Registry itself is the fiction: a routing layer that connects clients to specialists.

Think of it as **speculative worldbuilding** — the kind of document a shadow economy would produce if it had to onboard new clients. Professional. Deniable. Complete.

## Operating Principles (Canon)

These apply to every Registry member:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Discretion** | No client identification retained. No engagement documentation post-closure. |
| **Deniability** | Outcomes read as natural consequence. No attribution. |
| **Prepayment** | Cryptocurrency or structured finance. No fiat trace. No refunds. |
| **Referral** | No unsolicited intake. Introduction through existing client or verified channel. |

## Sector Taxonomy

Providers cluster by capability. Overlap exists; that's intentional. Clients may need multiple providers for a single objective.

| Cluster | Providers | Domain |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Influence & Resolution** | [NULL AXIS](packages/NULL_AXIS/README.md), [DARK MIRROR](packages/DARK_MIRROR/README.md) | Strategic pressure. Reputation. Terminal outcomes. |
| **Exfiltration & Oblivion** | [ZERO SIGNATURE](packages/ZERO_SIGNATURE/README.md), [RED ACT](packages/RED_ACT/README.md), [PHANTOM NET](packages/PHANTOM_NET/README.md), [DEAD LETTER](packages/DEAD_LETTER/README.md) | Disappearance. Erasure. Evacuation. |
| **Evasion & Invisibility** | [BLIND SPOT](packages/BLIND_SPOT/README.md), [QUIET FLOOR](packages/QUIET_FLOOR/README.md) | Surveillance countermeasures. Sonic obfuscation. |
| **Intelligence & Access** | [WHISPER CHAIN](packages/WHISPER_CHAIN/README.md), [OPEN WINDOW](packages/OPEN_WINDOW/README.md), [HARD COPY](packages/HARD_COPY/README.md) | Human intel. Physical entry. Document acquisition. |
| **Financial Obfuscation** | [VOID SHELL](packages/VOID_SHELL/README.md), [SHADOW LEDGER](packages/SHADOW_LEDGER/README.md), [DEEP POCKET](packages/DEEP_POCKET/README.md) | Asset protection. Ledger masking. War chests. |
| **Attribution & Misdirection** | [PARALLAX](packages/PARALLAX/README.md), [FALSE DOOR](packages/FALSE_DOOR/README.md) | Blame shifting. Decoy operations. |
| **Severance & Isolation** | [BURNED BRIDGE](packages/BURNED_BRIDGE/README.md), [COLD TRAIL](packages/COLD_TRAIL/README.md) | Contact termination. Case collapse. |
| **Enforcement & Acquisition** | [IRON MOUTH](packages/IRON_MOUTH/README.md), [SILENT HAND](packages/SILENT_HAND/README.md), [NIGHT RUN](packages/NIGHT_RUN/README.md), [BLACK BOX](packages/BLACK_BOX/README.md) | Confidentiality. Transport. Recovery. |

## The Registry Itself

The Registry **routes**. It does not operate. It maintains the index, vets inquiries, and connects capacity to need. In-world, it is the interface between the legitimate world and the deniable one.

**Tagline:** *The Registry exists. We don't ask why. We route.*

---

## Limitations (Out-of-Universe)

- No timeline. No geography. No named jurisdictions.
- Providers are independent. No hierarchy. No central command.
- The fiction is the documents. There is no "behind the scenes" that contradicts the written word.

**What if** a client needed disappearance *and* reputation repair? [NULL AXIS](packages/NULL_AXIS/README.md) + [ZERO SIGNATURE](packages/ZERO_SIGNATURE/README.md) + [DARK MIRROR](packages/DARK_MIRROR/README.md). Multi-provider engagements are canonical.

**What if** you're building something in this universe? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The taxonomy is expandable. New sectors welcome.

**What if** you're curious about the gaps? No provider does everything. The overlaps and lacunae are intentional.
