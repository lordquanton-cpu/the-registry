# The Registry — Testimonials Index

**Classification:** Meta. Reference.  
**Purpose:** Consolidated testimonials and provider value propositions.  
**Canon:** Discretion precludes attributed client quotes. All entries anonymous. Operational handles only.

---

## Canon Note

Registry members do not retain client identification. No names. No jurisdictions. Testimonials appear only as **anonymous, post-closure** references. Operational handles (e.g., R-xxxx) where used are fictional. Deniability preserved.
